    Integrate MailerLite in Liquidpoll plugin.

== Description ==

Integration with MailerLite to Liquidpoll plugin.

By using MailerLite and LiquidPoll together with this integrator plugin, you can directly onboard users with a poll and get them segmented by their responses into the MailerLite database according to **Groups**.

You can add subscribers or participants based on the following 2 ways or in combination of these:
    1. Option Selected > Add custom group
    2. Lead Form Submitted > Add custom group

So the user’s journey is **Respond to poll** > **Complete the form** (Name, Email etc.) > **Submit**

Done! The user would be added to your subscribers list.

**Required Plugins**
    * [LiquidPoll Free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-poll/) or [LiquidPoll PRO](https://www.liquidpoll.com/pro/)
    * LiquidPoll – MailerLite Integration plugin


### How to use?
To transform any poll into a MailerLite input you need to have this integrator plugin installed. Any member or participant who are responding to your poll gets automatically added and grouped by this process.

### Polls Connected to Subscribers & Groups
Any poll you have created can be assigned to a MailerLite **Subscribers** or **Groups**.

Simply go to the **Form** tab of your poll and add the groups want to associate.

### Poll Responses Connected to Group
Any poll options can also be associated with a group you have created in MailerLite.

In the **Options** tab of your poll, simply select the **group** against each option.

This integration only works with multi choice polls right now, it does not work with NPS or reaction type polls.
